ClusterAssigner component for dynamic weight-to-cluster assignment.

This module provides comprehensive cluster assignment functionality with:
- Multiple assignment strategies (nearest, similarity, quality, hierarchical)
- Dynamic assignment optimization and rebalancing
- Assignment history tracking and rollback
- Quality assessment and improvement suggestions
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Integration with ClusterIndex and ClusterHierarchy
