| 50 | 1 | 50.00x | 7,537 tensors/sec |
| 100 | 1 | 100.00x | 7,795 tensors/sec |

**Analysis**:

|--------------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| 10 | 0.42MB | 42.8KB | 394.5 weights/sec |
| 35 | 1.45MB | 42.3KB | 407.7 weights/sec |
| 85 | 3.50MB | 42.1KB | 401.3 weights/sec |

**Analysis**:
- Consistent storage overhead per weight (~42KB)
- Stable throughput regardless of repository size
- Linear storage growth indicates good scalability

**Recommendations**:
- Current scaling behavior is acceptable
- Monitor storage growth in production environments

### 4. Concurrent Operations ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION

**Objective**: Test concurrent access and thread safety

| Threads | Success Rate | Throughput | Issues |
|---------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | 100.0% | 196.5 ops/sec | None |
| 2 | 100.0% | 187.4 ops/sec | None |
| 4 | 50.0% | 192.7 ops/sec | File not found errors |

**Analysis**:
- Single and dual-threaded operations work perfectly
- Failures occur with 4+ concurrent threads
- Errors suggest missing staging directory race conditions

**Critical Issues**:
- Thread safety problems in concurrent operations
- Staging directory synchronization issues
- Potential data corruption risk under high concurrency

**Recommendations**:
1. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Implement proper file locking for staging operations
2. **HIGH PRIORITY**: Add thread-safe directory creation
3. Test with higher concurrency levels after fixes
4. Consider using database transactions for atomic operations
